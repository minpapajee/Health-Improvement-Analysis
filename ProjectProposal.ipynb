    "Diabetes is a chronic health disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. Diabetes affects many Americans today, and it is the eighth leading cause of death in America. (1) There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. With diabetes, the body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should. This can lead to serious problems such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease. Diabetes is incurable, but there are many factors that are within human control. (2) That leads us to our question: What are the significant relationships between biological and health factors, such as age, BMI, blood glucose level, etc., and diabetes?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an abundance of research on the topic, but many prior works are focused on the connection of sociodemographic factors and diabetes. This can be helpful to our research, as many sociodemographic factors are directly correlated to health and biological factors. In fact, one work finds extremely high correlation between low socioeconomic status and diabetes. Low socioeconomic status is also found to be directly related to high body weight and lack of exercise, which supports the idea that obesity is a big factor in diabetes. (3) \n",
    "\n",
    "Other works find many lifestyle factors to be a strong force behind the cause of diabetes. Most notably are lack of exercise, weight, and poor sleep. (4) Our research aims to find other factors that may be helpful in the prevention of diabetes or even the treatment of it. \n",

The ideal dataset that we would want to be able to answer this question is one that includes many biological and health variables, ideally including age, BMI, and blood glucose level, among others. We would like to have numerous observations of both people with diabetes and people without so that we can examine if there truly is a relationship between these variables and having diabetes.\n",

    "We understand that there can be many biases in our research. For example, our datasets might be focused on just one country or just one race. This can create a bias in our project as limiting the research to a certain population of a country or race will only give information about these specific groups of people. We reduce bias by finding data that includes a large group of people that encompasses worldwide diabetes cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s also the case where data points could be focused on people that already have diabetes instead of a general population of people. To avoid this, we can choose data that encompasses a wider range of people to avoid a “survivor” bias. More specifically, there should be an even split between diabetic and non-diabetic people to have a better proportion of data"
